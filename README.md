> A really useful and easy to use bot.
## Installation Guide
This guide will cover all the steps needed to get a bot up and running from absolute scratch using my source code. If you stumble across any issues with setting it up, my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/r4bsXez) is the right place to seek help.
Please note though, I strongly advice that you have a decent understanding of JavaScript, Node.js and discord.js before diving into this.
### 1. Creating a Bot Account
*  Open your browser, go to Discord's [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), click on `New Application` and give your application a name.

* Click on the application you've just created and navigate into `Bot`. Here you can give your bot a username, description (that will show up in the About Me section) and an avatar. You want to make sure that the `Server Members Intent` stays enabled.

* In order to have your bot join any servers, you have to create an invite link. The invite url will contain your bot's user ID (which you can copy from the `Application` menu). Simply replace `[your_bot_id]` with your bot client ID you just copied in the template below, then use it to invite the bot.
  ```
  https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[your_bot_id]&permissions=268561494&scope=bot%20applications.commands
  ```
### 2. Connecting The Code To The Bot
* Before downloading the bot's source code, you must download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

* You can now proceed to download [the latest code](https://github.com/Focus04/focus/releases). Scroll to the latest release and download the corresponding zip file, then extract it somewhere on your computer.

* Navigate into the folder you've just extracted (which should contain all the code), right click and open a new terminal in the folder (my recommendation would be [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/powershell/releases) if you're a Windows user). Use the following command to install all the dependencies:
  ```
  npm i
  ```

* Go back to the `Developer Portal` into your browser and navigate into `Bot`. Here you want to click on `Copy` to copy your bot's token. This token is the password for your bot account, so you want to keep that as secure as possible in an environment variable.

* Open the code using your preferred text editor (I recommend sticking to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). To speed this up, you can type `code.` in the terminal.

* With your text editor, navigate into the `.env` file and replace `your_bot_token` with the token you just copied, then hit save. 
### 3. Configuring the bot
  * The bot offers suggestions and bug reporting features. For those to work, you have to create 2 channels for suggestions and bug reports respectively.

  * Right click on the suggestions channel, then hit `Copy ID`. Replace the `changeme` in the `suggestionChId` field with the ID you copied.

  * Repeat for the bug reports channel by editing the `bugChId` field.

  * You can finally edit your `botInviteLink`, `discordInviteLink`, `topgg`, `website` and `github` fields with your own urls (or leave them empty).

  * You can also edit the `package.json` file.
### 4. Setting up the database
  * Here comes the trickier part, setting up a MongoDB database for the bot to store its data in. Start by registering an account at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

  * Navigate to `Databases`, then hit `Create`. Select your prefered options (there are options for free tier clusters too). When you're done, click `Create Cluster`. The creation process can take several minutes, so be patient.

  * Once the cluster goes live, click on `Browse Collections` and hit `Create Database`. Here you have to create a database for each field in the `.env` file (25 in total). You can start with `bannedUsers`. The name of the database is up to you but make sure it's something suggestive as you'll need it later. You can now click `Create`.

  * Repeat for the remaining fields (`disabledCmds`, `kks`, `leaveMessages`, `leaveChannels`, `logChannels`, `msgLogs`, `mts`, `mutedMembers`, `names`, `notes`, `prefixes`, `punishments`, `reminders`, `rolePickers`, `suggestionChannels`, `toggleLeaveMsg`, `toggleWelcomeDm`, `toggleWelcomeMsg`, `welcomeChannels`, `welcomeDms`, `welcomeMessages`, `welcomeRoles` & `wrns`).

  * Go back to your cluster overview, click `Connect` and choose the second option. Here you have to choose `Node.js` and the `2.2.12 or later` version. Copy the connection string. Replace `database_url` with the url you copied in all fields of the `.env`. Replace `<password>` with the password you set on your cluster. Replace `myFirstDatabase` with the name of the database that you created for the corresponding field. There should be 25 databases in total, which equates to 25 connection strings.
### 5. Generating API Keys
  * In order for the weather command to work, you'll need to generate a key for the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Register an account there.
  
  * On the homepage, click on your username and go to `My API keys`.

  * Input a name for your key and hit `Generate`.

  * Copy the newly generated key, go to the `.env` file and replace `your_open_weather_map_api_key` with it.
### 6. Starting up the bot
  * At this point you're pretty much done. You can now run the following command in your terminal to start the bot. Remember to use it everytime you update the source code:
  ```
  node .
  ```
